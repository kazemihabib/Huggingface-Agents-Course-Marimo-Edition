        # Solving a complex task with a multi-agent hierarchy

        This notebook is part of the [Hugging Face Agents Course](https://www.hf.co/learn/agents-course), a free Course from beginner to expert, where you learn to build Agents.

        ![Agents course share](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/communication/share.png)

        The reception is approaching! With your help, Alfred is now nearly finished with the preparations.

        But now there's a problem: the Batmobile has disappeared. Alfred needs to find a replacement, and find it quickly.

        Fortunately, a few biopics have been done on Bruce Wayne's life, so maybe Alfred could get a car left behind on one of the movie set, and re-engineer it up to modern standards, which certainly would include a full self-driving option.

        But this could be anywhere in the filming locations around the world - which could be numerous.

        So Alfred wants your help. Could you build an agent able to solve this task?

        > üëâ Find all Batman filming locations in the world, calculate the time to transfer via boat to there, and represent them on a map, with a color varying by boat transfer time. Also represent some supercar factories with the same boat transfer time.

        Let's build this!

        - Each agent is more focused on its core task, thus more performant
        - Separating memories reduces the count of input tokens at each step, thus reducing latency and cost.
