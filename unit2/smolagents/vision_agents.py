        ## Providing Images at the Start of the Agent's Execution

        In this approach, images are passed to the agent at the start and stored as `task_images` alongside the task prompt. The agent then processes these images throughout its execution.  

        Consider the case where Alfred wants to verify the identities of the superheroes attending the party. He already has a dataset of images from previous parties with the names of the guests. Given a new visitor's image, the agent can compare it with the existing dataset and make a decision about letting them in.  

        In this case, a guest is trying to enter, and Alfred suspects that this visitor might be The Joker impersonating Wonder Woman. Alfred needs to verify their identity to prevent anyone unwanted from entering.  

        Letâ€™s build the example. First, the images are loaded. In this case, we use images from Wikipedia to keep the example minimal, but image the possible use-case!
