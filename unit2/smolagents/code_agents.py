        ## Selecting a Playlist for the Party Using `smolagents`

        An important part of a successful party is the music. Alfred needs some help selecting the playlist. Luckily, `smolagents` has got us covered! We can build an agent capable of searching the web using DuckDuckGo. To give the agent access to this tool, we include it in the tool list when creating the agent.

        For the model, we'll rely on `HfApiModel`, which provides access to Hugging Face's [Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index). The default model is `"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct"`, which is performant and available for fast inference, but you can select any compatible model from the Hub.

        Running an agent is quite straightforward:
